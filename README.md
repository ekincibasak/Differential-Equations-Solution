# Differential-Equations-Solution
Linear and  Nonlinear  Differential equation solution in  Fortran and Matlab.

While the .m file gives the solution to the linear differential equation in Matlab, 
the .f90 file gives the solution to the nonlinear differential equation. 

The solution of the linear equation gives the solution to the  neutrino equation of motion in the Sun. 

The solution of the nonlinear equation gives the solution to the  neutrino equation of motion in the SÃ¼pernova.
